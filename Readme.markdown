# SSMessagesViewController

Simple message UI like Messages.app. I started writing this to create an in-app SMS feature for a client.

## Running the Demo

Just open Xcode and build away. Enjoy.

Fork by n1mda includes UITextView instead of drawing NSString, so phonenumbers/links etc can be detected.
